This code consists of a simple client-server program. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, receives commands from clients, executes those commands in the server's shell, captures the output of the commands, and sends the output back to the client. The client connects to the server, sends commands to it, and displays the server's responses.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does for both the server and the client:

Server:
1. Initializes variables, including a socket descriptor, port number, and buffer for 2. receiving commands and sending responses.
2. Creates a socket using the socket() function.
3. Sets up the server's address structure and binds it to a specific port using the bind() function.
4. Listens for incoming client connections using the listen() function.
5. Accepts incoming client connections using the accept() function.
6. Receives commands from the client in a loop, executes those commands using popen(), captures the command output, and sends the output back to the client.
7. The server continues this loop until it receives a command from the client with "End" as its content. At that point, it breaks out of the loop and closes the sockets.

Client:
1. Initializes variables, including a socket descriptor, port number, and buffer for sending commands and receiving responses.
2. Parses command-line arguments to get the server's IP address and port number.
3.Creates a socket using the socket() function.
4. Resolves the server's hostname to an IP address using gethostbyname().
5. Sets up the server's address structure with the resolved IP address and port number.
6. Connects to the server using the connect() function.
7. Sends commands entered by the user to the server.
8.Reads and displays the responses from the server.
9. The client continues to send commands and display responses until it sends a command containing "End." At that point, it closes the socket and exits.

In summary, this code creates a basic client-server architecture where the server accepts commands from the client, runs them on the server's shell, captures the output, and sends it back to the client. The client sends commands to the server and displays the responses received from the server.


- - - How to Run - - - 

Compile Code:
gcc server.c -o server
gcc client.c -o client

Run Server & Client:
./server&
./client 127.0.0.1 12255

Run Commands on the Client to see Server output, while server doesn't print.
